Love is like a butterfly. It goes where it pleases and it pleases where it goes.
爱情就像一只蝴蝶，它喜欢飞到哪里，就把欢乐带到哪里。

If I had a single flower for every time I think about you, I could walk forever in my garden.
假如每次想起你我都会得到一朵鲜花，那么我将永远在花丛中徜徉。

Within you I lose myself, without you I find myself wanting to be lost again.
有了你，我迷失了自我。失去你，我多么希望自己再度迷失。

At the touch of love everyone becomes a poet.
每一个沐浴在爱河中的人都是诗人。

Look into my eyes - you will see what you mean to me.
看看我的眼睛，你会发现你对我而言意味着什么。
